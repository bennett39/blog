First, a pet peeve: A lot of bloggers will tell you that reading alone won’t change your life. They say things like, _“You have to apply what you read!”_

**That sounds kinda preachy**. I bet most of those hawking that advice aren’t very good at applying books either.

I argue that **it’s okay not to apply most of what you read**.

[James Altucher](https://www.quora.com/profile/James-Altucher) (his _Choose Yourself_ is a great book for the list) recently interviewed [Stephen Dubner](https://www.quora.com/profile/Stephen-Dubner) (his _Freakonomics_ is a good book for the list) and asked him how much of a book he remembers after reading it. Dubner does a ton of research, and he wrote the Freakonomics books, so he should be pretty good at remembering stuff right?

Know what he said? **1–2%**. He only remembers and uses 1–2% of any book he reads.

You’re not gonna be much different, and that’s ok.

If you **only learn one thing** from a book, then it was worthwhile to read it.

So when I give you my list of books, you don’t need to “apply everything you learn in order to change your life!” That’s a good way to get disappointed when you fail.

Instead, focus on getting one key takeaway from a book and letting the changes in your life gradually add up. Keep reading enough, and you’ll have new thoughts. New thoughts lead to a few new habits and new habits change lives.

These books have been important to me. I like them, maybe you will too. If not, that’s okay. **Just read something.**

My favorite book is: _The Little Prince_ by Antoine de Saint-Exupery.

Here are some other good books that I like and recommend.

*   A Farewell to Arms — Ernest Hemingway
*   A Walk in the Woods — Bill Bryson
*   The Four Hour Workweek — Tim Ferriss
*   Bird by Bird — Anne Lamott
*   The Prince — Machiavelli
*   The Brief and Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao — Junot Diaz
*   I Will Teach You To Be Rich — Ramit Sethi
*   Invisible Man — Ralph Ellison
*   High Fidelity — Nick Hornby
*   Cutting for Stone — Abraham Verghese
*   Ready Player One — Ernest Cline
*   Linchpin — Seth Godin
*   What Makes Sammy Run — Budd Schulberg
*   The War With the Newts — Karel Capek
*   The Things They Carried — Tim O’Brien
*   The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay — Michael Chabon
*   Awaken the Giant Within — Tony Robbins
*   Kafka on the Shore — Haruki Murakami
*   Born Standing Up — Steve Martin
*   Open — Andre Agassi
*   Biography of Benjamin Franklin — Walter Isaacson
*   The Checklist Manifesto — Atul Gawande
*   Antifragile — Nassim Taleb
*   Counselor: A Life at the Edge of History — Ted Sorensen
*   Biography of Benjamin Franklin — Walter Isaacson

There’s more, but I’ll leave you with those.

You’ll notice a lot of fiction. I’m of the — somewhat unpopular — opinion that fiction can teach us as much as nonfiction, in addition to being more fun to read.

I hope one of these books helps you.

Mostly just read anything, and you’ll already be ahead of the game.
