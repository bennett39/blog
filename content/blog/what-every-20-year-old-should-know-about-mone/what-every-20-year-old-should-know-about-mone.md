# **Forget frugality. Start earning more instead.**

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/600//0*79DGsplnE4AoM5go.)

Almost all of the blogs on personal finance focus on budgeting and saving. They ask you to cut back.

*   _“If you give up your morning latte, you can invest that money in a low-fee index fund through a Roth IRA.”_

Gag me with a spoon.

That’s fine if you want to pinch pennies.

You can only cut so much out of your budget, though. This is especially true if you’re 20-years-old. You’re probably living with roommates and eating ramen.

If you want to live a fulfilling life, budgeting and restricting yourself isn’t going to help. The key to being financially successful is not saving.

**_It’s earning more._**

Think about it. You can save and save and save, and have a few more dollars at the end of the month. OR, you can start earning more.

If you [get a raise](http://www.comfortableconversation.com/get-a-raise-and-new-job), [land a new job](http://www.comfortableconversation.com/your-dream-job/), [start a side hustle](http://www.sidehustlenation.com/ideas/), or [create a business](http://100startup.com/), you make thousands more per year.

You can only save so much. The potential to earn more is limitless.

# **We don’t want to think about money.**

I know that’s an odd thing to say for someone writing about personal finance, but hear me out.

The reason to learn about finance is not because you love currency or monetary theory. Most of us learn about personal finance so that [we don’t have to think about money](http://www.brokepedia.com/saving-more-money-vs-earning-more/) all the time.

When you’re being frugal, you’re constantly thinking about money. It’s stressful.

When you start earning more, you can comfortably spend on the things that are important to you without guilt.

There are ways to set up automatic systems to make all of this easier, too.

# **Automatic systems for managing your money**

Ideally, you could set up your finances and then just forget them. That’s what I’ve done. I just check in every few months to make sure everything looks right.

My Roth IRA gets automatically funded each month. My bills are autopaid. I save in my rainy day fund automatically. I even put aside $100/month for fun hobbies and things I’d like to splurge on.

I’ve used Ramit Sethi’s method in order to do that.

[Automating your Personal Finances — I Will Teach You To Be Rich](http://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/automate-your-personal-finances/)

Read that link. It’s better than anything I could write here.

# Once you have your finances automated:

Learning how to **negotiate and hustle** are the best things you can do for your finances as a 20-year-old. So, here’s a challenge for you:

Try to start your own business —

1.  Do not spend any money trying to create your product
2.  Find something people will pay you money for (Solve a problem)
3.  If you can, have 3 clients pay you before you ever make the product
4.  Make the product
5.  Get referrals for new customers
6.  Continue…

Even better, try getting rejection therapy:

*   Ask for phone numbers from attractive people
*   Ask strangers for money or a favor
*   When buying lunch, ask for a discount
*   Email an important person and get no response

Learning to overcome your fear of rejection will also lead to financial independence in the long run. Why? Because it’ll make you less afraid to ask for the contract, bonus, promotion, benefit, or opportunity.

People who ask for things are infinitely more likely to get what they want. If you don’t ask, how can you expect to get what you want?

# And please, **don’t get into debt**.

That would be just dumb. Especially credit card debt.

There are a few types of debts that are acceptable as investments in your future. They are:

*   Student loans
*   Mortgages
*   Car loans

Even these debts are risky though. You probably shouldn’t buy a house at 20-years-old. When you do, buy a small one you can pay off easily. Same goes with the car. Stick to used cars for now.

Credit card debt is such a no-go, because of the high interest rates. Although you should have some form of credit card and pay it off every single month. **This builds credit history.**

—

# **_TO RECAP:_**

1.  Automate your finances
2.  Learn to hustle and negotiate
3.  Earn more via promotions, job changes, side hustles, and building businesses
4.  Don’t get into debt doing it

That’s the way to financial freedom.
